            <h3>13. Termination of Service</h3>
            <p><u>We</u> reserve the right to terminate or suspend access to the Service for any violation of these Terms or in the case of fraudulent or illegal activity. This includes, but is not limited to, failure to make payments, misuse of the Service, or violation of intellectual property rights.

In addition, we reserve the right to pursue further action and investigation for any damages caused by chargebacks or payment disputes. Upon termination, any outstanding payments will be immediately due.</p>

            <p>
                Rarely, <u>we</u> may terminate the Service to you if we determine the project or website is not a good fit for our services. We'll only provide a pro-rata refund calculated using the Service period and the days elapsed from the start of the Service. We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.
