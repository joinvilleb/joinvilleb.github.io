        <h2>Introduction & Geography</h2>
        <h3>Location</h3>
        <p>Sweden is a country that is located in Northern Europe, bordering the Baltic Sea, 
        and is between Finland and Norway. Stockholm is the capital of Sweden. The country had a significant role during World War II, 
        which you can learn more about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden_during_World_War_II">at this Wikipedia page</a>.

    <figcaption>This is where Sweden is located, in the orange highlighted part of the map. </figcaption>

        <h4>Climate and Terrain</h4>
        <p>
        Sweden is a large country, which means that the northern and southern points experience huge shifts in climate.
        Northern Sweden experiences subartic temperatures. Probably not the best place to go if you are wanting to spend time outdoors!
    And, in southern Sweden, you experience cold, cloudy winters and cool, partly cloudy summers. </p>

        <h4>Area and comparative area to the United States</h4>
        <p>The size of Sweden could be compared to three times the size of Georgia of the United States. The total area is <strong>450,295 sq km</strong> with a total land area of <strong>410,335 sq km</strong>.
       The country ranks the 58th largest country in the world. 
        </p>

        <h2>People and Society</h2>
        <h3 class="section-header">Demographic profile</h3>
        <p>This is an interesting section as it is quite different from the United States.
        Swedish society is very gender equal, and men and women in the country agree that both parners should contribute to household income (which is how it should be).
        </p>

        <p>There is a generous leave policy and high-quality subsidized childcare which allows mothers and fathers to balance work and family life.
        In fact, Swedish women have one of the highest labor participation rates in Europe, and one if its highest total fertility rates. 
        Beginning in 2008, Sweden began a new era of labor immigration as companies were <strong>encouraged to hire non-EU workers.</strong>
        Not surprising, but as of 2020, <strong>over a quarter of Sweden's population had a migrant background. </strong>
        </p>

        <h4>Religions</h4>

                </table>
        
        <p>While not everyone is associated with a religion in Sweden, there is still active participation in Sweden. On the official government website <a href="https://sweden.se/life/society/religion-in-sweden">here</a>,

        <strong>1.7 million</strong> out of the entire country as of 2023.

                <li>
                    <strong>The Act of Succession</strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>The Freedom of the Press Act</strong>

        <p>There are also amendemnts to the constitution. Any amendments sought to be made to the constitution are first proposed by Parliament. 
        </p>

        <h4>Branches of government</h4>

        <p>There are three branches of government in Sweden. They are the <strong>Executive branch</strong>, 
            the <strong>Legislative Branch</strong>, and the <strong>Judicial branch</strong>. 
            </p>
