    <h1>My name is Billy Joinville. Welcome!</h1>

    <br />
    <h2>About me: </h2>
    <p>I am currently twenty years old, and I am from Delaware. I currently study at the University of Miami - and a fun
        fact about me is that I can speak Haitian Creole fluently.</p>
    <dl>
        <dt><u>Before attending the University of Miami</u></dt>
 
        <dd>High school was a crucial time for me to start getting involved in extra-curricular activities.
            I became involved with running and joined the Cross Country, and track and field team <b>during all 4 years
                of high school. </b>
            In addition, I volunteered a total of 300 hours at the time of my high schoool graduation.
            To get closer within my community, I served as a youth board member for the ARK Educational Resource center
            in Laurel, Delaware.
        </dd>


        <dt><u> During my time at the University of Miami </u></dt>

        <dd>I am currently a sophomore student at the University of Miami, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in
            Communication Studies.
            I have had the pleasure to serve on executive board for a few organizations on campus. Planet Kreyol, a
            Haitian student organization has introduced me to tons of new connections.
            From that experience, I bave been able to serve as a co-events chair for the organization. To continue my
            passion for running, I joined the running club on campus, <b>Club Running!</b>
            After being elected as President of the running club, I have made it my mission to help fellow runners like
            myself, succeed and accomplish great things!
        </dd>


        <dt><u>Future endeavors</u></dt>

        <dd>As of current, I am still taking courses at the University of Miami. My dream is to become a software
            enginner.
            Taking this course will allow me to learn new fundamental skills needed to excel in my career and I am
            confident that by the end of this term I will be proficient in HTML and CSS.
            I also plan to return back to the North East after graduation, to find a job that is closer to home but in a
            large city - preferrably New York City, or even DC.
            To conclude, I am excited of where I am today - that I was able to get accepted into the University of Miami
            to pursue my degree, and
            I am excited to see where my degree takes me from here on out. Thank you so much for reading and I hope you
            enjoy the rest of the website.

    <h2>Need a personal trainer? Here is all that you need to know.</h2>

    <p>As you have read from the About me section, you know that I am an avid runner. I've ran during my time in high
        school,
        and I have continued that at the University of Miami - where I now serve as president of the club. I want to
        take my passions further and become a personal trainer.
        This is a huge step for me, and I am looking forward to meeting my future clients. I have had dreams of being a
        personal trainer and I think this is the right step for me,
        because of my passion for helping others. I believe that good things will come to those are who are selfless and
        who take care of one another.
        I also understand that there will be some upsides, and downsides to becoming a personal trainer - but I hope
        that we, as in <i>me and you </i>, work through that together when that time comes.
        Knowing this, there are some information that I would like to share about getting started having me as a
        personal trainer.

        <dd>Rescheduling appointments must be done in person. I am not allowed to share my phone number on this website
