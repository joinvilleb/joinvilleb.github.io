      <h2> Computer Science Major | Technology Enthusiast | Problem Solver </h2>

      <br>

      <p>I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at the University of Miami, with a minor in Communication Studies. </p>

      <p>My passion lies in leveraging technology to create meaningful solutions that address real-world challenges. 
        Whether it's software development, data analysis, or exploring new & evolving technologies like AI, I enjoy turning complex problems into efficient, innovative solutions.
      </p>
        
      <p>Throughout my academic journey, I’ve worked on diverse projects and held leadership roles that combine my technical skills with business acumen. 
        From my role as a Youth Board Member at The ARK to being an active member of Alpha Kappa Psi, I continuously strive to bridge the gap between technology and its impact on society.
