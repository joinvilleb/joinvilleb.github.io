      <h2>Discovering My Passion for Computing</h2>

      <p>Born in Seaford, Delaware, and raised in Salisbury, Maryland, I embarked on my technological journey at James M. Bennett High School. </p>

      <p>It was there, at the age of 16, that I first explored the world of computing. Starting with user-fiendly platforms like <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> 
      and <a href="https://code.org">Code.org</a>, I quickly discovered a craving for logical thinking and problem-solving. This level of thinking led me to enroll in an introductory Computer
      Science course during high school, which set the foundation for my academic pursuits in the field. </p>

      <p>After a positive experience in the introductory course, I advanced to taking an Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science course, where I strengthened my understanding
      and solidified my passion for the field.

      <h2> Area of Study and Current Ambitions</h2>

      <img src="images/sebastian-and-billy.jpg" alt="An image Sebastian, left and Billy, right."/>

      <p>As a dedicated Computer Science student at the University of Miami, my academic and personal endeavors revolve around deepening my understanding and enhancing my skills in programming and software development.
        I am particularly passionate about addressing real-world problems through innovative software solutions. This passion not only drives my project choices but also guides my learning path.
      </p>

      <p>Throughout my studies, I have focused on mastering both the theoretical and practical aspects of computer science. My coursework and projects are selected to build a robust foundatin in coding,
        while also exploring advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning.
      </p>

      <p>I thrive on challenges that allow me to think critically and collaborate with others in a team to develop a solution to a problem. For instance, I have engaged in projects that tackle
        inefficencies in existing software systems, in return developing user-friendly and streamlined solutions that increase efficencies in the workplace. </p>

      <p>My ultimate goal is to contribute to technology that not only solves a problem but makes a crucial impact on society. Whether that is developing software that enhances the user experience
        or assists with environmental conservation, I am eager to use my skills to make a difference. As I continue to further my skill set and work on more complex projects, collaborating with others will be a priority.
        The best ideas come from the one who is the most silent in the room, and through teamwork, major breakthroughs have the opportunity to happen. I look forward to opportunities where I can contribute, learn, and grow within the tech community.
