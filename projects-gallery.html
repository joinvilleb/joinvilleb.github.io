            <p>In the summer of 2023, I collaborated on developing a new software solution integerating Power BI and Microsoft Dynamics to streamline operations and
                enhance analytics capabilities at Delaware Elevator, Inc.  </p>

            <p>Through this experience, I have strengthened my collaboration and critical thinking skills by resolving conflicts in a proper manner and taking a multi-step approach towards
                completing challenges as they arose. I have also learned how to effectively communicate with other team members to ensure that the project was working as expected
                and that we completed all of our tasks in a timely manner.

            <h2>Spotify Community Star</h2>

            <p>Since 2018, I have been a member of the Spotify Community, a forum where users go to get help, share ideas, and collaborate with other fans. As a super user,
                I assist other users with troubleshooting and questions that arise with any of Spotify's services. This can range from a basic troubleshooting request such as "my Spotify app keeps crashing",
                to something more complex such as "how do I find an account, transfer my content over, and learn more about the AI DJ feature?". You can find all of my replies to users through my <a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/17854488">Community profile page</a>.

                <figcaption>There are some cool perks to being a Spotify Star, such as all-expense paid yearly trips to Spotify's headquarters! Above, was a picture of me next to the Spotify logo in their
                Stockholm office.

            <h2>Lab technician at the University of Miami</h2>

            <img src="images/billy-it.jpg" alt="Billy actively working in the Information Technology Department">

            <p>Since Fall of 2022 at the University of Miami, I have managed personal computer (PC) encryption while maintaining loaner inventory. This is a crucial department at the University,
                ensuring that laptops and desktops are encrypted in a timely manner, while also improving the efficency of technology management. Through this experience, I have learned fundamental
                time management skills, while also learning how to collaborate and solve conflicts as they arise with other co-workers. These skills being applied to my technical duties have brought me a robust
                work experience, while being a full-time student at the University.

            <h2>UX Research and Design Initiatives </h2>

            <img src="images/usertesting.jpg" alt="UserTesting dashboard where incoming tests come in">

            <p>A crucial part of computing involves creating innovative software solutions that enhance the user experience. To that end, and knowing my passiobn for technology and software,
                I have started freelance website testing through <a href="https://www.usertesting.com">UserTesting, Inc.</a> providing my experience and feedback on various prototypes and mockups, to make websites better. Through that experience,
                I have gained critical thinking skills and public speaking skills as I regularly interact with real representatives from companies seeking feedback from their users.
